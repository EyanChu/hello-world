    <p>The 992-generation 911 GT3 was jointly developed with Porsche Motorsport. This seventh-generation new car
        has the purest racing technology and provides purer performance. Derived from the equally
        high-performance Porsche GT racing car 911 RSR, the front axle of the 911 GT3 is equipped with a double
        A-arm independent suspension system. It fully demonstrates its superiority through a spoiler rear wing,
        a Swan Neck link and a powerful splitter. Advanced aerodynamic technology; the 510hp 4.0-liter
        six-cylinder boxer engine designed based on the 911 GT3 R powertrain has already passed endurance race
        testing. Both the 911 GT3 and 911 GT3 Cup are equipped with ultra-high-revving engines and captivating
        sounds. They are not only sports cars that satisfy the owner's daily driving pleasure, but also a track
        machine with superb performance and excellent power, creating an extraordinary driving experience.</p>
