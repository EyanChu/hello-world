    <h2>Lexus LM</h2>
    <img class="info-img" src=https://www.topgear-magazine.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/lexus_lm_06.jpg>
    <p>The new generation Lexus LM offers a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-four-cylinder hybrid and a
        2.4-liter turbocharged hydroelectric power, although actual performance figures have not yet been
        announced. The biggest advantage of Lexus LM is that it has an eye-catching appearance and luxurious
        interior atmosphere, wide seating space, and a rear seat configuration comparable to tens of millions of
        luxury cars, which is a rare car on the market as a van.</p>
