        custom-made billet crankshafts, and new piston connecting rods. In addition, the turbine size has also

        suit mob, with a maximum horsepower of 850 horsepower, a torque of 142.8kg-m, zero hundred acceleration
        in only 4.1 seconds, and the top speed is limited to 250km/h, which is paired with the same upgraded
        9-speed automatic transmission and AWD full-time four-wheel drive system.</p>
